# CiTE-Low-Pass-Filter
Full implementation of a fourth-order low-pass filter. The circuit design is based on the use of two cascaded second-order Sallen-Key configurations. Presented as the final project of CiTE (Circuits i Tecnologies Electr√≤niques),  part of the third course of the Electronic Engineering degree (BSc).
